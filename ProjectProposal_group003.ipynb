Preferably we would like to gather data that separates the revenue from tickets, advertisement, food sale during the game in order to see in which categories the revenue was seriously affected by the pandemic. We would like this dataset to be from a reputable source hopefully from the organizers of the game itself and stored as clean, structured data."

    "The potential ethical problems that could occur with this data project is that we could potentially reveal financial information that an industry would rather have hidden. Revealing this information without permission from that industry could result in competitors to take advantage of the financial information to adjust their business practices to pressure the industry or have stakeholders change how much money they would wish to give the sports industry. To counteract this problem, we should only use data that has been made publicly available by the industry that would be affected by our project. We would also need to be careful to try and make appropriate conclusions based on the data that we are given. We should not make claims of causation if there is no data to prove that causation. It could also be important to include background information of what the sports industry is doing to combat the pandemic issue to provide context on the situation."
